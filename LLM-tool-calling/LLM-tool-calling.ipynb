    "# LLM tool calling\n",
    "\n",
    "> Disclosure: A DeepSeek-R1 LLM was involved in drafting some of the summarizing text in this tutorial. Where this was the case, it is indicated by a footnote stating the prompt. The tiny class used for queries to the LLM-as-a-service is shown in Appendix&nbsp;A. All other text and code examples were written by a human.\n",

    "## What is _tool calling_?<sup>1</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool Calling in LLM Queries: A Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**: Tool calling is a technique where Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret user input as commands to invoke external tools, services, or APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Functionality**: It enables models to execute tasks beyond their training data by interacting with databases, cloud services, custom scripts, and other systems in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Purpose**: Enhances the model's capabilities, allowing it to perform dynamic actions based on user requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benefits**:\n",
    "   - Extends LLM functionality.\n",
    "   - Facilitates complex tasks through natural language input.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Challenges**:\n",
    "   - Potential security risks if inputs aren't properly sanitized.\n",
    "   - Requires robust error handling and API integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach bridges the gap between NLP capabilities and external systems, offering versatile applications in automation, data retrieval, and more."

    ">\n",
    "> 1. **Cats have scent glands on their faces**: Cats have scent glands located on either side of their nostrils, as well as on their lips, chin, and near their whiskers.\n",
    "> 2. **Cats can\\'t taste sweetness**: Unlike humans, cats lack the taste receptors for sweetness. This is because they are obligate carnivores and don\\'t need to detect sweetness in their diet.\n",
    "> 3. **A group of cats is called a \"clowder\"**: Yes, you read that right! A group of cats is officially known as a clowder.\n",
    "> 4. **Cats have three eyelids**: In addition to their upper and lower eyelids, cats also have a third eyelid called the nictitating membrane or \"haw.\" This helps keep their eyes clean and protected.\n",
    "> 5. **Cats can jump up to 5 times their own height**: Cats are known for their agility and jumping ability. They can leap impressive distances, thanks to their powerful leg muscles and flexible spines.\n",
    "> 6. **Cats purr to self-soothe**: While cats often purr when they\\'re happy or content, they also purr when they\\'re stressed, scared, or even giving birth. Purring is a way for cats to calm themselves down and regulate their breathing.\n",
    "> 7. **Cats have unique nose prints**: Just like human fingerprints, each cat\\'s nose print is unique and can be used to identify them.\n",
    "> 8. **Cats can sleep for 16 hours a day**: Cats are notorious for their love of sleep. On average, they spend around 16 hours per day snoozing, with some cats sleeping as much as 20 hours in a 24-hour period.\n",
    "> 9. **Cats can hear sounds that are too faint for humans to detect**: Cats have extremely sensitive hearing and can pick up sounds that are too quiet for humans to detect. They can also hear sounds at higher frequencies than humans can.\n",
    "> 10. **Cats can\\'t see in complete darkness**: While cats have excellent low-light vision, they can\\'t see in complete darkness. Their eyes contain a reflective layer called the tapetum lucidum, which helps them see better in low light conditions.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> These are just a few of the many fascinating facts about cats that you can find on MeowFacts. Whether you\\'re a seasoned cat owner or just a cat enthusiast, there\\'s always more to learn about these amazing animals!"
