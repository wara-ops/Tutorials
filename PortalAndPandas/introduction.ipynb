    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will work with log data from the Xerces cloud service that is running in the Ericsson Research Data Center (ER DC) in Lund. The goal is to introduce you to the WARA-Ops portal and learn how to work with large data sets from a real-world cloud service.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Running and operating large-scale systems is a highly complex task. Data centers and cloud systems consist of a large number of moving parts. They are designed to be fault-tolerant and survive that components, such as disks, servers, and switch, occasionally break. This is typically handled through redundancy, i.e., using multiple identical subsystems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data-driven operations are a set of ideas and tools that combine concepts from several fields with the purpose of creating systems that self-manage. The area is becoming essential as modern computing and communication systems rapidly grow in size and complexity; managing these systems by hand is simply no longer possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the systems still break and require manual intervention. Typically this involves scanning through vast amounts of log-files to find out what is causing the outage and identify the root-cause. In the WARA-Ops project we aim at developing technology to do this automatically using for example machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The logs you will be looking were collected over approximately two weeks in the summer of 2023. Something broke around the first of June. We still don't what went wrong. If you find out, please let us known. It's very high volumes of data. The system emits 1200 log items per second. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we want you to learn how work with real-world data sets, which are typically large, noisy, and undocumented. You should learn how to explore the data and find correlations, anomalies, etc., by for example visualising it or reducing dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ERDC\n",
    "\n",
    "ER DC and Xerces is operated by a team of IT professionals and adheres to strict Ericsson security and safety policies. This is important to protect potentially sensitive user data. We have been up and running since 2014 and serve many hundreds of researchers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The entire data hall was designed for 2MW, but present, only 300-400kW is consumed (imagine the electricty bill!). The hardware setup on Xerces is approximetly\n",
    "\n",
    "- 300 servers (20+cores, 256+GB RAM)\n",
    "- 16 Nvidia V100 GPUs\n",
    "- 48 Nvidia A100 GPUs \n",
    "- 36 Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti GPUs\n",
    "- 2 PB storage (spinning disc)\n",
    "- 50 TB NVMe storage\n",
    "- Dell 100 Gbps network fabric\n",
    "- External Internet 2x10 Gbps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OpenStack\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenStack is an open-source cloud computing platform that enables businesses and organizations to deploy and manage their own clouds. It is freely available and can be customized to fit the specific needs of an organization. OpenStack is designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing users to control large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering users to provision resources through a web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenStack consists of a set of independent subsystems or core components. The logs item that you will explore are emitted from theses subsystem. Sometimes you might want to look at the system as a whole and sometimes you want to zoom in on a particular component. Below is an incomplete list of the modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nova (Compute)**: Nova is the part of OpenStack that's responsible for managing and automating the pool of compute resources. These resources can be virtual machines or container instances. Nova interacts with the underlying virtualization technologies to manage the lifecycle of compute instances within OpenStack.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Swift (Object Storage)**: Swift provides a scalable object storage system that can handle large amounts of unstructured data at a high level of availability. It's designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere â€“ websites, mobile applications, IoT sensors, etc. It's highly durable and available, ensuring data is always accessible when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cinder (Block Storage)**: Cinder offers persistent block storage to running instances. Its role is akin to that of a traditional hard drive, providing storage to virtual machines but with the flexibility and convenience that comes with virtualized environments. You can think of Cinder as providing the \"hard drives\" for your virtual machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Neutron (Networking)**: Neutron delivers \"networking-as-a-service\" capabilities in OpenStack. It allows users to create and attach interfaces to networks and provides the API for users to define network connectivity and addressing in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Horizon (Dashboard)**: Horizon is the graphical interface for OpenStack. It's a web-based dashboard that allows both administrators and users to manage and provision resources within OpenStack. Through Horizon, users can interact with OpenStack's various services without needing to use the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Keystone (Identity Service)**: Keystone provides identity services for OpenStack. It's responsible for user management, authentication, and authorization. Essentially, Keystone allows you to control who can do what in OpenStack.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Glance (Image Service)**: Glance allows users to discover, register, and retrieve virtual machine images. You can think of it as a repository or library of images that can be used to boot your virtual machines or instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Heat (Orchestration)**: Heat is a service to orchestrate multiple composite cloud applications using templates, through both an OpenStack-native REST API and a CloudFormation-compatible Query API.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just some of the core components that make up OpenStack, each playing a crucial role in providing a comprehensive cloud computing platform. OpenStack is highly modular, meaning you can often add or replace components to suit your specific needs, making it a highly versatile choice for cloud infrastructure."

    "## Using WARA-Ops data and resources\n",
    "\n",
    "WARA-Ops is a portal consisting of two parts. The data catalogue holds the data set. In this assignment you should be using the data set \"ERDClogs-parsed\", which consists of log data collected from the Xerces cloud service during the period 2023-05-21 -- 2023-06-03. The second part of the portal is a JupyterHub notebook compute service. You will find a link to the JupyterHub in the WARA-Ops portal. Please remember to generate a token so that you can access the data. \n",
